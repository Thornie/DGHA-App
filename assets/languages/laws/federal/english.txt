<h3>DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT: HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION </h3>
<p>Under the Federal Disability Discrimination Act 1992 amended 2009 (hereafter DDA) all assistance dogs are guaranteed access to all public places in Australia. </p>
<p>According to the DDA, if your assistance dog is appropriately trained and certified to assist you, and meets acceptable standards of hygiene and behaviour, than access to public spaces and services is guaranteed. There are circumstances under which access may be refused and these are detailed under Section 54A of the Act. If your dog has an infectious disease or threatens public health or the health of other animals you may legally be refused access. You are also obliged to produce evidence that your dog is a legitimate assistance animal when asked.
    Following successful completion of the Public Access Test, mindDog will give your dog an identity card. This will carry his picture and provide evidence that he is certified; however, this does not mean you will have a trouble-free experience.
</p>

<h2>Places used by the public include:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Public footpaths and walkways</li>
    <li>Banks, credit unions, building societies</li>
    <li>Hotels, motels, rental accommodation</li>
    <li>Social and sporting clubs</li>
    <li>Educational institutions</li>
    <li>Parks, public swimming pools, public toilets and pedestrian malls</li>
    <li>Theaters and other places of entertainment</li>
    <li>Libraries</li>
    <li>Shops and departments stores</li>
    <li>Cafes, restaurants and pubs</li>
    <li>Lawyers’ offices and legal services</li>
    <li>Sporting venues</li>
</ul>

<p>Your access rights to housing and accommodation are protected under the DDA whether it is public or private. Hotels and motels usually appreciate being told in advance that you will have your mindDog with you.
        Landlords often do not know that your rights are covered under the DDA and it may be necessary to educate them. In a rental situation it is not necessary to tell them about your mindDog when submitting an application as they may view your mindDog as a pet and refuse you accommodation. Your mindDog is considered to be a medical aid; if they wouldn’t refuse access to housing and accommodation to someone in a wheelchair, the same premise applies to a mindDog.
        The DDA takes precedence over other laws including state laws and local council regulations. The sole exception is The Civil Aviation Act 1988 (CAA), which contains a clause allowing an airline to refuse to carry an assistance animal or assistance dog if the airline has genuine concern that the size of the dog will be a danger on the flight.
        The DDA spells out your rights and responsibilities as a mindDog handler.

<h3><b>Human Rights Commission</b></h3>
<p> If you do have a problem and you and your dog are refused access to an area or service, the Human Rights Commission has a very straightforward method for making a complaint. You can do this on their web site and the whole process can be done by email if that suits you. Alternatively, you can contact us and we can advise you or assist you to make a complaint.
    Two of the best ways to avoid trouble is to make sure that your dog is always wearing his mindDog vest 
    when you go out together. If you are going somewhere that you haven’t been before, it may help to call ahead and 
    let them know you are coming. This can make all the difference in the world. Most people don’t like surprises and 
    if you are met with a bad reaction to your dog, it can be embarrassing and humiliating. 
    Always remember that you and your dog do have rights.
