<p>When a Guide Dog is in harness, whether it is walking, sitting or sleeping, it should not be patted, fed or distracted. It takes a lot of training and concentration for a person with vision loss to work safely with a Guide Dog. Please follow these tips to ensure that Guide Dogs and Guide Dog Handlers can successfully navigate the community together.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Guide Dog must not be the centre of attention. Please don’t pat feed or otherwise distract the dog when it is working. A well-intentioned pat can undo months of intensive training</li>
    <li>Please don’t grab onto the person or the dogs’ harness. Always ask if they need assistance</li>
    <li>When you provide guiding assistance, please walk on the person’s opposite side to the Guide Dog</li>
    <li>Please ensure your pet dog is on a leash or under control when near a Guide Dog. When approaching, it may be helpful to let the person know that you have a dog</li>
    <li>If you see a loose Guide Dog, please contact the local council</li>
    <li>According to government legislation, you must allow a Guide Dog to go anywhere that the person working with it can go</li>
</ul>
