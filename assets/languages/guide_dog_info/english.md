### How to Act Around Guide Dogs

When a Guide Dog is wearing a harness, whether it is walking, sitting or sleeping, it should not be patted, fed or distracted. It takes a lot of training and concentration for a person with vision loss to work safely with a Guide Dog. Please follow these tips to ensure that Guide Dogs and Guide Dog Handlers can successfully navigate the community together.

- The Guide Dog must not be the centre of attention. Please don’t pat feed or otherwise distract the dog when it is working. A well-intentioned pat can undo months of intensive training.

- Please don’t grab onto the person or the dogs’ harness. Always ask if they need assistance.

- When you provide guiding assistance, please walk on the person’s opposite side to the Guide Dog.

- Please ensure your pet dog is on a leash or under control when near a Guide Dog. When approaching, it may be helpful to let the person know that you have a dog. 

- If you see a loose Guide Dog, please contact the local council.

- According to government legislation, you must allow a Guide Dog to go anywhere that the person working with it can go.
