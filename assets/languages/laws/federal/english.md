### DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT

Under the Federal Disability Discrimination Act 1992 amended 2009 (hereafter DDA) all assistance dogs are guaranteed access to all public places in Australia.

According to the DDA, if your assistance dog is appropriately trained and certified to assist you, and meets acceptable standards of hygiene and behaviour, than access to public spaces and services is guaranteed. There are circumstances under which access may be refused and these are detailed under Section 54A of the Act. If your dog has an infectious disease or threatens public health or the health of other animals you may legally be refused access. You are also obliged to produce evidence that your dog is a legitimate assistance animal when asked. Following successful completion of the Public Access Test, mindDog will give your dog an identity card. This will carry his picture and provide evidence that he is certified; however, this does not mean you will have a trouble-free experience.
