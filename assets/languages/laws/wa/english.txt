<h2>Dog Act 1976
    Section/s applicable:
    Section 8, Special Provisions for Guide Dogs
    Excerpt from Section 8:</h2>

    <p>“(1) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act or in any other Act, regulation, local law or by-law a person who is blind or partially blind —
        (a) is entitled to be accompanied by a dog bona fide used by him as a guide dog, in any building or place open to or used by the public, for any purpose, or in any public transport; and
        (b) is not guilty of an offence by reason only that he takes that dog into or permits that dog to enter any building or place open to or used by the public or on any public transport. “

        <p>Most state-based legislation does list a number of areas where dog guides are not permitted and, in some cases, this is not consistent with the provisions stated under the Federal Disability Discrimination Act.
            As an example, under the Queensland Guide, Hearing and Assistance Animals Act, a dog guide is not permitted in an ambulance, while the Federal Disability Discrimination Act on the other hand would not prevent a dog guide from being permitted in the vehicle.
            The Australian Constitution states that in instances where a state law conflicts with a federal law, the federal law prevails.
            In some cases, state-based legislation may actually be of more use to you in the event that you are refused access to a public place with your dog guide as the Disability Discrimination Act remains unresponsive until a complaint has been lodged.
            All state-based legislation, however, with the exception of Western Australia’s Dog Act 1976, gives police and local councils the jurisdiction to issue a penalty notice for failure to comply with the Act. This penalty amount may be a fixed amount, or may be determined by a number of ‘penalty units’. The value of a penalty unit varies between states and may change on an annual basis.
            After the issuing of fines was explored further with police and local councils in NSW, it became evident that there was little understanding of their authority in this area and, in some cases, little awareness of the areas where dog guides were permitted. 
            Blind Citizens Australia followed up on this issue by addressing a letter to the NSW Commissioner of Police, who has subsequently contacted the NSW Education and Training Command to recommend that all relevant training packages be reviewed to ensure that they appropriately emphasise the provisions of the NSW Companion Animals Act. The NSW Police Handbook is also being updated to include a chapter on assistance animals 
            which will highlight the provisions and offences under the Act. This will then be reinforced by a Commissioner’s Instruction and article in the Police Monthly.
            Blind Citizens Australia will be working with Dog Guide Handlers Australia, a consumer-based organisation that has been established to promote the interests of dog guide handlers in Australia, to address this matter more systemically and ensure that police and local councils are aware of their ability to issue fines for refusal of assistance animals.
            Although dog guides are permitted in most public areas under law, it is important to understand that there are a number of responsibilities that come along with this. Under both federal and state legislation, it is not unlawful for you to be asked to produce evidence to verify that your dog is a registered assistance animal. 
            It is also not unlawful for you to be refused access to public premises if your dog does not meet an appropriate standard of hygiene or is not under your direct control, or the control of another person.
